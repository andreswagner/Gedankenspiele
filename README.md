# Gedankenspiele
These days we are very much surrounded by so many interesting phenomena in our everyday life, as well as with some amazing technology we could only dream about a few decades ago. We do have all the necessary tools to capture the data that somehow tells the story we are living in, as well as the tools needed to run from simple analysis to very much complex ones on it in just a few minutes. It's hard not to see the opportunity we do have in front of us, a totally different way to learn, share and engage with others and ourselves. I'm creating this repository for that purpose: to let our minds freely play with stories that are currently relevant in our day-to-day lives, stories told with data and analysis, colored with findings, assumptions thoughts and predictions.
